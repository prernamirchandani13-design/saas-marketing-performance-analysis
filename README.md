# saas-marketing-performance-analysis
Analysis of B2B SaaS marketing performance across paid and organic channels using SQL and spreadsheets, focusing on ROAS, CAC, and growth insights.

**Project Overview**
This project analyzes B2B SaaS marketing performance across multiple channels to understand ROI, CAC, and overall efficiency of paid vs organic efforts.

The dataset simulates real-world marketing data across:
Meta Ads
Google Ads
LinkedIn Ads
Organic
Email

The goal was to answer a simple but important question:
Where should a B2B SaaS company actually spend its marketing budget?

**Objectives**
Compare performance across paid and non-paid channels
Analyze ROAS, CAC, conversions, and revenue
Identify high-performing and underperforming channels
Generate actionable marketing insights for budget allocation

**Tools Used**
Excel – Data cleaning, calculations, pivot tables
MySQL – Data import and querying
GitHub – Version control & documentation

**Key Metrics Analyzed**
Spend
Leads
Conversions
Revenue
ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)
CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)

**Key Insights**
1. Meta Ads Perform the Best
Highest ROAS among all paid channels
Strong revenue generation relative to spend
Indicates efficient targeting and scalable performance

**Recommendation:** Increase or maintain Meta ad spend while optimizing creatives.

3. Google Ads Are Moderate
Lower ROAS than Meta
Still generates conversions, but at higher cost

**Recommendation:** Optimize keywords and intent-based campaigns before scaling.

4. LinkedIn Is the Most Expensive Channel
Highest CAC
Lowest ROAS among paid channels

**Recommendation:**
Use LinkedIn selectively for:
High-ticket enterprise deals
Brand awareness
Retargeting, not cold acquisition

5. Organic & Email Are High-Value Channels
Zero monetary investment
ROAS appears as NULL due to no spend
Still contribute to leads and conversions

**Recommendation:**
Double down on:
Content marketing
SEO
Email nurturing workflows
These channels improve profitability long-term.

**Strategic Takeaways**
1.Paid channels drive scale, but efficiency varies
2. Organic and email significantly improve overall marketing ROI
3. Meta should be the primary paid growth lever
4. LinkedIn requires tighter use cases to justify cost
